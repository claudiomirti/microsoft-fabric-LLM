At US 750 per night, it is the most expensive hotel I have ever stayed in, anywhere. The location is great, the staff is fantastic, and arranged for our transportation from the airport when we arrived and to the train station when we left. The public areas and rooms were lovely. The 30 euro breakfast was delightful. Really the only thing that seemed odd was that the lobby and hallways are not air conditioned, and the a/c in our rooms was barely adequate. We are from Houston and were surprised that a hotel of this caliber and price point had this sort of issue.

When we went to our rooms the first thing we noticed were 3 fellows sitting on the side of the parking lot at a picnic table drinking beer from a cooler. Then when I took our girls to the pool, one is 7 and one is 14, there were 3 young men in the pool who supposedly did not speak English. There were some teenage girls leaving the pool as we came in. We later found out they were so uncomfortable by the mens stares they left until a parent could come out with them They stared at our girls until it was uncomfortable. They waited until our 14 year old went under to swim and then one dove into the pool and accidently ran into her. My husband finally came and sat by the pool so we would feel safe. Needless to say we did not swim long. Our phone did not work in our room. They finally switched the phone and the second one did not work either and they basically told us sorry about your luck there is nothing we can do. My husband messed around with the connection until he got it working. The air conditioner didn't work real well either. The room was not the cleanest, not totally filthy, but could have definately used a good scrub. The door in one room did not seem to lock tight and we moved a chair in front of it to make sure no one could get in.

When we went to our rooms the first thing we noticed were 3 fellows sitting on the side of the parking lot at a picnic table drinking beer from a cooler. Then when I took our girls to the pool, one is 7 and one is 14, there were 3 young men in the pool who supposedly did not speak English. There were some teenage girls leaving the pool as we came in. We later found out they were so uncomfortable by the mens stares they left until a parent could come out with them They stared at our girls until it was uncomfortable. They waited until our 14 year old went under to swim and then one dove into the pool and accidently ran into her. My husband finally came and sat by the pool so we would feel safe. Needless to say we did not swim long. Our phone did not work in our room. They finally switched the phone and the second one did not work either and they basically told us sorry about your luck there is nothing we can do. My husband messed around with the connection until he got it working. The air conditioner didn't work real well either. The room was not the cleanest, not totally filthy, but could have definately used a good scrub. The door in one room did not seem to lock tight and we moved a chair in front of it to make sure no one could get in. We asked for one room to be switched but was told no the owner would not want to.","7":["same floor","first thing","parking lot","picnic table","3 young men","mens stares","air conditioner","good scrub","second one","teenage girls","adjoining rooms","one room","2 rooms","6 people","3 fellows","side","beer","cooler","pool","English","parent","14 year","husband","phone","luck","connection","door","chair","front","owner"],"8":"service","index":107},{"0":"Garden Grove","1":"33.78814","2":"-117.916591","3":"Anaheim Marriott Suites","4":"4.0","5":"I just returned home after a weekend at the Anaheim Marriott Suites hotel, and was very pleased with the friendly, attentive and professional staff at the hotel.

I really appreciated the microwave and refrigerator as that helped to ensure we had the option to not spend every meal dining out. The sofa was a fold out bed which, while not the most comfortable way to sleep, was a great option that allowed me to save by not getting a 2 bedroom suite.

There was no bar at the hotel but we were able to purchase wine from the lobby shop. After we ordered what we wanted and went to the room, the reception called to advise that the only red wine they now had was the most expensive one (almost double the others!) Very annoying !!!

There was a misunderstanding about discounts on weddings that take place during the week- evidently, they calculated the discount without letting me know what the full price was. Also, they displayed the supplement desserts and ice cream before our cake was served, which didn't make any sense and I ended up taking home most of my wedding cake. Also, reminder to brides: If your parents are part of the processional and have reserved seating, please have someone place wedding programs on their seats! Neither of our parents had programs during the service and this was disappointing and added confusion to their participation!Be aware, at the Hyatt Dulles you will pay 22% gratuity and 5% tax for all food and beverage- even the breakfast brunch, which was self serve and the omelette station wasn't manned during our brunch.

Inside the room it was large and all counter tops/tables remodeled with the same quartz as the front desk but inside the room was brown. The bathroom was also remodeled with body wash, shampoo, and conditioner dispensers on the inside of the wall but for our room, the body wash was completely drained and there were no bars of soap. There was one, clearly used bottle of body lotion by the sink but I feel soap is more important than lotion. We got in late and left early. This inn got the job done and that's about it.

When we went to our rooms the first thing we noticed were 3 fellows sitting on the side of the parking lot at a picnic table drinking beer from a cooler. Then when I took our girls to the pool, one is 7 and one is 14, there were 3 young men in the pool who supposedly did not speak English. There were some teenage girls leaving the pool as we came in. We later found out they were so uncomfortable by the mens stares they left until a parent could come out with them They stared at our girls until it was uncomfortable. They waited until our 14 year old went under to swim and then one dove into the pool and accidently ran into her. My husband finally came and sat by the pool so we would feel safe. Needless to say we did not swim long. Our phone did not work in our room. They finally switched the phone and the second one did not work either and they basically told us sorry about your luck there is nothing we can do. My husband messed around with the connection until he got it working. The air conditioner didn't work real well either. The room was not the cleanest, not totally filthy, but could have definately used a good scrub. The door in one room did not seem to lock tight and we moved a chair in front of it to make sure no one could get in.

I enjoyed the hotel's location as it was much quieter than Venice. It felt very safe for me to be walking around at night and it was very convenient to get to and from Venice as there is a bus that stops directly out front. There are many good restaurants and shops around the corner that are much cheaper to eat at than in Venice if you are on a budget.

The first night we stayed at the Drury Inn in Grove City which was a 10-15 minute drive. That hotel was recently remodeled, so the rooms there were fresh looking and had a new feel to them.

The pros - nice view of the lake, comfortable bed and nice big room with a comfy chair, desk, and free wifi. The cons - while the room was nice (except that it had a fridge but no freezer and a loud AC that kept going on and off ALL NIGHT), the hallways STINK - the carpet is dirty, dated and smelly and I would highly suggest this place replace it QUICKLY as it really ruins the ambiance. The pool boasted being very kid friendly, had fun stuff and a great pool beach for kids - BUT it had a mat that was coming off the floor (missing a bolt) which was a HUGE tripping hazard, the fountain wasn't on, the water was way colder than advertised and the one day we actually ordered some food, it took over 45 minutes to get a few salads, chips and fruit. Molly working at the pool bar was terribly rude and should NOT be working in hospitality. The kid-zone...they have it all over the TV so my kids wanted to check it out...we finally made time to go and it was CLOSED! Nowhere did it mention that it's only open Fri-Sun, AND that you have pay 10/hr as a hotel guest for a bunch of bounce houses, a dirty baby area, and a ping pong table. Really While 10 an hour isn't a lot, that's exactly the point - why in the WORLD would you CHARGE your guess for this Ridiculous. Bottom line, the room was nice, the pool was ok - but I wouldn't come back to this hotel again.","index":183},{"0":"Telluride","1":"37.933273","2":"-107.850865","3":"Mountain Lodge At Telluride - A Noble House Resort","4":"5.0","5":"We stayed in a 2 bedroom for 3 nights in early Feb 2016 and we loved it.

The apartment was fabulous and contained everything we could possibly need. Simona, our main contact,was full of personality and warmth. She made us happy to be there. I can't say enough about this hotel. We wanted to ask the people on staff including the owner to have dinner with us!!

The pros - nice view of the lake, comfortable bed and nice big room with a comfy chair, desk, and free wifi. The cons - while the room was nice (except that it had a fridge but no freezer and a loud AC that kept going on and off ALL NIGHT), the hallways STINK - the carpet is dirty, dated and smelly and I would highly suggest this place replace it QUICKLY as it really ruins the ambiance. The pool boasted being very kid friendly, had fun stuff and a great pool beach for kids - BUT it had a mat that was coming off the floor (missing a bolt) which was a HUGE tripping hazard, the fountain wasn't on, the water was way colder than advertised and the one day we actually ordered some food,  it took over 45 minutes to get a few salads, chips and fruit. Molly working at the pool bar was terribly rude and should NOT be working in hospitality. The kid-zone... they have it all over the TV so my kids wanted to check it out... we finally made time to go and it was CLOSED!

The pros - nice view of the lake, comfortable bed and nice big room with a comfy chair, desk, and free wifi. The cons - while the room was nice (except that it had a fridge but no freezer and a loud AC that kept going on and off ALL NIGHT), the hallways STINK - the carpet is dirty, dated and smelly and I would highly suggest this place replace it QUICKLY as it really ruins the ambiance. The pool boasted being very kid friendly, had fun stuff and a great pool beach for kids - BUT it had a mat that was coming off the floor (missing a bolt) which was a HUGE tripping hazard, the fountain wasn't on, the water was way colder than advertised and the one day we actually ordered some food, it took over 45 minutes to get a few salads, chips and fruit. Molly working at the pool bar was terribly rude and should NOT be working in hospitality. The kid-zone...they have it all over the TV so my kids wanted to check it out...we finally made time to go and it was CLOSED!

The pros - nice view of the lake, comfortable bed and nice big room with a comfy chair, desk, and free wifi. The cons - while the room was nice (except that it had a fridge but no freezer and a loud AC that kept going on and off ALL NIGHT), the hallways STINK - the carpet is dirty, dated and smelly and I would highly suggest this place replace it QUICKLY as it really ruins the ambiance. The pool boasted being very kid friendly, had fun stuff and a great pool beach for kids - BUT it had a mat that was coming off the floor (missing a bolt) which was a HUGE tripping hazard, the fountain wasn't on, the water was way colder than advertised and the one day we actually ordered some food,  it took over 45 minutes to get a few salads, chips and fruit. Molly working at the pool bar was terribly rude and should NOT be working in hospitality. The kid-zone... they have it all over the TV so my kids wanted to check it out... we finally made time to go and it was CLOSED!

Since I was not happy about that, he then checked to see what he could do and found a room with a king bed. Kudos to him for that but the room must have had pets in it previously because every time I stood still on the carpet, something would bite me. I assume it must have been fleas so rather than go through the hassle of changing rooms, I did not stand still on the carpet and thankfully the critters didn't follow me home. I told the girl at the desk about the issue so hopefully the room was properly cleaned and treated. Shame on the pet owners who bring their bug infested pets into a hotel room making it worse for the next guest.","index":25},{"0":"Port Clinton","1":"41.52469","2":"-82.85883","3":"Holiday Inn Express Hotel and Stes Port Clinton-catawba Island","4":"4.0","5":"Excellent Our stay was very enjoyable.

So as we were still relaxing in the room, housekeeping kept attempting to gain access to the room - still never mentioning that we should have checked out at 10am. I had to call the reception to ask them why we were being constantly bothered by housekeeping, only then did we find out the crazy early check out time. Very annoying!!!!!!! 2. There was no bar at the hotel but we were able to purchase wine from the lobby shop. After we ordered what we wanted and went to the room, the reception called to advise that the only red wine they now had was the most expensive one (almost double the others!) Very annoying !!!

I called for an extension I was willing to pay for and they said no. I travel a lot, and that was a first.

He was humorous, helpful and took my phone number down to call and let me know if I could check in early. I did manage to do an earlier check in and the entire front desk crew were incredible. Very lively pool area (loud but fun) and the rooms are delightful. Looks renovated, amazingly comfortable bed, I was on the 5th floor facing a quiet area, cute bathroom, clean and so convenient. Only thing I would have liked is a refrigerator as I'm used to the chains like Marriott and Hampton Inns etc., however, with a foodstore opposite and Starbucks plus other stores, it was no big deal. Will definitely stay there again. Will admit though that the direct rate booking through hotel website was cheaper than Expedia but it was too late, I had used Expedia for this booking.","index":88},{"0":"Rockford","1":"42.27388","2":"-88.9672","3":"Extended Stay America - Rockford - I-90","4":"3.0","5":"We traveled to Rockford for a soccer tournament at the last minute.

There was a misunderstanding about discounts on weddings that take place during the week- evidently, they calculated the discount without letting me know what the full price was. Also, they displayed the supplement desserts and ice cream before our cake was served, which didn't make any sense and I ended up taking home most of my wedding cake. Also, reminder to brides: If your parents are part of the processional and have reserved seating, please have someone place wedding programs on their seats! Neither of our parents had programs during the service and this was disappointing and added confusion to their participation!Be aware, at the Hyatt Dulles you will pay 22% gratuity and 5% tax for all food and beverage- even the breakfast brunch, which was self serve and the omelette station wasn't manned during our brunch.

Inside the room it was large and all counter tops/tables remodeled with the same quartz as the front desk but inside the room was brown. The bathroom was also remodeled with body wash, shampoo, and conditioner dispensers on the inside of the wall but for our room, the body wash was completely drained and there were no bars of soap. There was one, clearly used bottle of body lotion by the sink but I feel soap is more important than lotion. We got in late and left early. This inn got the job done and that's about it.

When we went to our rooms the first thing we noticed were 3 fellows sitting on the side of the parking lot at a picnic table drinking beer from a cooler. Then when I took our girls to the pool, one is 7 and one is 14, there were 3 young men in the pool who supposedly did not speak English. There were some teenage girls leaving the pool as we came in. We later found out they were so uncomfortable by the mens stares they left until a parent could come out with them They stared at our girls until it was uncomfortable. They waited until our 14 year old went under to swim and then one dove into the pool and accidently ran into her. My husband finally came and sat by the pool so we would feel safe. Needless to say we did not swim long. Our phone did not work in our room. They finally switched the phone and the second one did not work either and they basically told us sorry about your luck there is nothing we can do. My husband messed around with the connection until he got it working. The air conditioner didn't work real well either. The room was not the cleanest, not totally filthy, but could have definately used a good scrub. The door in one room did not seem to lock tight and we moved a chair in front of it to make sure no one could get in.

Etna to our right, to the sea at our feet, it was truly breathtaking. Day excursions to Siracuse, Mt. Etna and Castlemola plus a day just wandering around town made for an unforgettable vacation. The views from Etna and Castlemola were simply breathtaking - as was the drive up narrow, winding roads! Another pleasant surprise was the quality of Sicilian wines. The luxury apartments of the Villa Carlota were first class is all respects.

It was Saturday and they told me there wouldn't be a manager until Monday morning (I ended up calling Tuesday at noon, no manager showed up on Monday.) Those two hours were spent unpacking the car, debating whether or not we should leave, and above all, taking pictures of the whole mess. I'll be disputing this with my bank.

The cons - while the room was nice (except that it had a fridge but no freezer and a loud AC that kept going on and off ALL NIGHT), the hallways STINK - the carpet is dirty, dated and smelly and I would highly suggest this place replace it QUICKLY as it really ruins the ambiance. The pool boasted being very kid friendly, had fun stuff and a great pool beach for kids - BUT it had a mat that was coming off the floor (missing a bolt) which was a HUGE tripping hazard, the fountain wasn't on, the water was way colder than advertised and the one day we actually ordered some food, it took over 45 minutes to get a few salads, chips and fruit. Molly working at the pool bar was terribly rude and should NOT be working in hospitality. The kid-zone...they have it all over the TV so my kids wanted to check it out...we finally made time to go and it was CLOSED!
