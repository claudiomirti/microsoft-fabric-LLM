The intimidating-looking, and instantly recognizable Stegosaurus was the largest of plate-backed prehistoric herbivores. Scientists have suggested that the Stegosaurus’ iconic plates were for defense against predators, but this is unlikely as the plates were quite thin. Others have said the Stegosaurus’ spiked tail may have been used as a weapon. Terra’s Stegosaurus toy accurately recreates the formidable size and terrifying presence of this iconic predator.

An unusual spin on a typical roll-the-dice-and-move game, it spotlights the mathematical concept of place value and gives kids reinforcement in what makes our base-10 number system tick. Each player is allotted one dinosaur for each of the four tracks (the tracks are labeled 1s, 10s, 100s, and 1000s). To play, a player rolls four dice to create a 4-digit number and then moves his or her prehistoric posse to the appropriate 1s, 10s, 100s, and 1000s places. Problem-solving strategies are honed as players scurry to get all four miniature mammoths or tiny triceratops into the dino haven, ahead of the other players' thundering herds. But look out! In the race to dino utopia, it's easy to get bumped by a baby brachiosaurus! The Dino Math Tracks game provides multiple levels of play for a variety of ages. At the simplest level (perfect for a first-grader who knows Arabic numerals and one-to-one correspondence), kids use only the place track for the 1s. Later, cards with simple problems are introduced (\"\"Stuck in a tar pit! Move your 10s dino back two spaces!\"\"). At the most advanced level","3":" players might encounter a question like this: \"\"Your 10s dinosaur forgot its pants","4":" so it went back 15 to get them. Then it hurried forward 25.

S. armed forces since then. In order to survive the increasing demands of battlefield operations, it has undergone numerous upgrades and improvement throughout the past 30 years. First produced in the Warren Army tank plant, Detroit, Michigan, U. S. A. in October 1963, the type M60A1 variant has been acknowledged one of the masterpieces in U. S. armor history. Major improvements found in the A1 version was the M68 105mm main gun, which was mounted in a sleek wedge-shaped monobloc-cast turret. The U. S. Marines, who currently operate he M60A1 tank, have opted not to upgrade it to the A3 version because of plans to employ the M1A1 Abrams main battle tank. However, they did install the state-of-the-art reactive armor array on their M60's for improved survivability against shaped-charge missiles and shells, calling the tank an M60A1 + (plus). The externally mounted reactive armor (ERA) used on the M60A1 + tanks is a bolt-on kit, that is spaced away from the main armor, adding additional dead air space for increased protection. Combined with the RISE (Reliability Improved Selected Equipment) program, including the improved stabilized gun, passive searchlight, a new air cleaner, etc. , the M60A1 + is highly capable of remaining in the front line operation as proved during the latest Persian Gulf Conflict. ??Requires paint and assembly. | 1.23 pounds (View shipping rates and policies)","3":"1.23 pounds","4":"ProductDimensions:15x9.6x2.8inches|ItemWeight:2.24ounces|ShippingWeight:1.23pounds(Viewshippingratesandpolicies)|ASIN:B000LFQTY0|Itemmodelnumber:TAM35157|Manufacturerrecommendedage:16-16years","index":403},{"0":"Redcat Racing BS903-089 2 X 10 Pin (12Piece)","1":"Genuine Redcat Racing Replacement part # BS903-089 | Use only genuine Redcat Racing Replacement parts to achieve the best performance with your Redcat Racing vehicles. | Please consult your user's manual to ensure this is the correct part for your model. | For troubleshooting and Warranty information please contact a Redcat Racing customer service specialist at 602-454-6445 or by emailing amazonsupport@redcatracing.Com | Compatible with the following Redcat Racing vehicles: caldera 10E, caldera 3.0, caldera SC 10E, caldera XB 10E, Earthquake 3.5, Earthquake 8E, fossa SC10, ground Pounder, piranha-tr10, Shredder","2":"Go to your orders and start the return Select the ship method Ship it! | Go to your orders and start the return Select the ship method Ship it! | 0.32 ounces (View shipping rates and policies) | show up to 2 reviews by default Redcat Racing Part # BS903-089 2*10 pins (12 pieces). compatible with the following Redcat Racing vehicles: CALDERA 10E, CALDERA 3.0, CALDERA SC 10E, CALDERA XB 10E, EARTHQUAKE 3.5, EARTHQUAKE 8E, fossa SC10, ground POUNDER, piranha-tr10, shredder.

The first candidates step forward, a motley bunch indeed. Which one has the skills to become a worthy member of the gang? To determine this, the boss himself stages a smuggling contest. First the would-be smugglers must try to get through a hole in a fence while carrying the biggest sack of contraband possible. Then those who make it through the hole have a chance to inspect the other smugglers' sacks that are smaller than their own or that shamefully got stuck in the hole in the fence. A role of the die determines which size hole in the fence the sack needs to fit through. The smuggling sacks are formed from a rubbery polymer putty that the players roll into balls with the contraband pieces hidden inside. The balls are then rolled down a track toward the fence. The player's goal is to form the largest ball that will still fit through the fence. Players who succeed in getting the largest ball through the hole in the fence can then guess the contents of the smaller balls or of balls that were too large to fit through the fence. If they guess correctly, they get to keep the contraband. The player who collects the most contraband items wins.

Fun and educational. Real places represented on game board. Amazon.com Monopoly, move over--this fun new Boston board game is going to give you a run for your Atlantic City money. Designed for and by Boston natives, it's got all the landmarks that make Bean Town such a special city--Beacon Hill, Fenway Park, the USS Constitution, and more. Like Monopoly, this game for two to six players starts with everyone receiving a stash of cash. With a roll of the dice, the players round the board, landing on various properties like the Old North Church, Copley Place, or the Union Oyster House. When you land on a property, you can opt to purchase it, trade it, or pay rent. Two kinds of wild cards, Big Fun and Contingency, spice up the competitive action. Anyone who owns large blocks of property can build a skyline, or, when it's fully developed, trade the buildings in for the key to the city. For those poor souls who exhibit poor financial judgment, there's always the option of a mortgage--if the IRS doesn't get them first--to keep their dreams afloat. --Marianne Painter See all Product description | 1.95 pounds (View shipping rates and policies)","3":"1.95 pounds","4":"ProductDimensions:15.4x10.6x2.1inches|ItemWeight:1.9pounds|ShippingWeight:1.95pounds(Viewshippingratesandpolicies)|DomesticShipping:ItemcanbeshippedwithinU.S.|InternationalShipping:ThisitemcanbeshippedtoselectcountriesoutsideoftheU.S.LearnMore|ASIN:B00000JMNU|Itemmodelnumber:5510941|Manufacturerrecommendedage:8yearsandup","index":730},{"0":"Fisher-Price Nickelodeon Shimmer & Shine, Teenie Genies Multi-Pack, Season 3 #5","1":"Make sure this fits by entering your model number. | Welcome to Zahramay Falls, a magical world where genies live, work and play!

On a spaceship 50 miles long with more than a million colonists, Epsilon City was the single largest habitation. It was filled with entertainment centers, apartments, and offices for all the people moving about the ship during the long voyage. The city was designed to be maintained by its own artificial intelligence (A.I.) and a special series of robots that could repair areas of the city when breakdowns happened. Epsilon City was less than half full when an interstellar radiation cloud destroyed the people of the ship and turned 99% of them into piles of white ash. The city was wiped out. Now, three hundred years later, things are vastly different in the city. The A.I. is insane and has an aggressive personality. The special robots have had to change or be destroyed, and have mutated much like the rest of the life on the ship. Wolfoid packs now inhabit many sections of the city and consider this metropolis their lair. And many more dangers lurk, hidden and waiting to be explored. The original edition of Metamorphosis Alpha has celebrated its 40th anniversary! In honor of this milestone, creator James M. Ward has authorized Goodman Games to publish Metamorphosis Alpha: Epsilon City. This huge expansion for the starship Warden is the biggest expansion for the original 1976 edition ever published!
